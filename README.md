# Emacs Config Files

My emacs config files. They are mainly focused on OSX but should work on any OS (although I cannot guarantee it).

## Installation

Clone this repo with:
```
git clone https://github.com/AnshumanNeon/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

## Updates

To have your configs updated with mine pull from the repo to have it updated:
```
git pull
```

## Customising Config

To customise the configuration to your own taste, you are free to do so! Just clone the repo and make changes in the files for your own config.
